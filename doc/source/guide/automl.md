# Pipeline One More Step: AutoML

It tries to use `Optimization` algorithms to optimize the selection of `ML` and the parameters of `ML`.

`AutoML` (Automated Machine Learning) tries to let automatically finish the following tasks:

- `Data Cleaning`
- `Data Preprocessing`
- `Feature Engineering`
- `Algorithm Selection`
- `Hyperparameter Optimization`

## What could `AutoML` do now?

- Part of `Feature Engneering`
- `Algorithm Selection`
- `Hyperparameter Optimization`

`Hyperparameter Optimization` already has the iterable method such as the `Grid Search`.
