    """
    Calculate the weighted score of selected columns in the DataFrame.

    The weighted score is the sum of the values in the DataFrame multiplied by
    the weights. A sugar syntax wraps::

        (df * weights).sum(axis=1) / sum(weights)

    Parameters
    ----------
    weights : list, dict or Series
        The weights of each column in the DataFrame.
        - list : The weights of each column in the DataFrame.
        - dict : Receive datastructure like ``{column: score}`` or
         ``{new_column: {column: score}}``.
        - Series : The weights must be a series with the same index as the DataFrame.

    validate : bool, default False
        If True, require the sum of weights values equal to 1.

    drop : bool, default False
        If True, drop the used columns.

    Returns
    -------
    DataFrame or Series

    Raises
    ------
    TypeError
        - If one of the weight values is not number type.
        - If weights is not a list, a dict or a Series type.

    ValueError
        - weights is list type
            - If the length of weights is not the same as the number of DataFrame
             columns.

        - weights is Series type
            - If the labels of the weights are not in the DataFrame columns.
            - If the labels of the weights are duplicated.

        - If ``validate=True`` and the sum of weights values is not equal to 1.
