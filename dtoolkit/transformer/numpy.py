    A transformer could return a contiguous flattened array.

    This transformer is used to handle that sklearn model requires ``y``'s
    shape is ``(n, )``. But actually we always forget this. So you would get
    a ``DataConversionWarning``.

    .. code-block:: python

        DataConversionWarning: A column-vector y was passed when a 1d array
        was expected. Please change the shape of y to (n_samples, ), for
        example using ravel().
